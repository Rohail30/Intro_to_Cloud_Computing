# 🧠 Networking & AWS VPC – Full Lecture Notes (Explained)

---

## 📚 **1. OSI Model – The 7-Layer Cake of Communication**

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is like a **blueprint** for how data moves through a network — from your app all the way to physical wires and back.

### 🔸 Layer 1: Physical

* **Think:** Cables, Wi-Fi signals, voltages.
* Sends raw **bits** (1s and 0s) over physical media.

### 🔸 Layer 2: Data Link

* **Adds MAC addresses** to help devices on the **same network** talk to each other.
* Prevents **collisions** using rules (like traffic lights).
* Uses **Layer 1** to actually transmit signals.
* **Example:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi

### 🔸 Layer 3: Network

* **IP addresses** live here.
* Makes **device-to-device communication** possible across different networks.
* Breaks data into **packets**, routes them using IP addresses.
* **Example:** Your computer in Karachi can talk to a server in London because Layer 3 knows where to send the packets.

### 🔸 Layer 4: Transport

* Adds **TCP or UDP**:

  * **TCP** ensures reliable, ordered delivery (like mailing a package with tracking).
  * **UDP** is fast, no tracking (like shouting across a room).
* Introduces **ports** (like doors) so multiple apps can talk at once (e.g., web on port 80, SSH on 22).

### 🔸 Layer 5: Session

* Maintains **sessions** between apps — e.g., your Zoom call or online banking session.
* Allows two-way ongoing communication.

### 🔸 Layer 7: Application

* Closest to the user.
* Deals with **actual apps** like browsers, email clients, etc.
* Understands data formats (e.g., HTML, JSON).

## 🔥 2. Firewalls – Bouncers for Your Network

Firewalls **inspect data** and decide whether to allow or block it, depending on what **layer** they operate at:

| Layer | What Firewalls Check                   |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| L3    | Source/Destination IP                  |
| L4    | TCP/UDP Protocol and Port              |
| L5    | Session awareness                      |
| L7    | Application-specific data (e.g., URLs) |

---

## 🌐 3. Proxy Servers

* A **middleman** between your internal systems and the internet.
* Used for **security, caching, or hiding identity**.
* Needs to be supported by the OS or app (e.g., configured in browser).

---

## 🏗 4. AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) – Your Private Data Center in the Cloud

### 🔸 What is a VPC?

* Your **own private network** inside AWS.
* Think of it as building your own secure office space in Amazon’s huge skyscraper (the cloud).

### 🔸 Key Traits:

* **Region-specific**
* Can have **public**, **private**, or mixed subnets.
* Can be connected to your real-world data center.

### 🔸 VPC & Subnets:

* CIDR Block size:

  * Max: `/16` = \~65,000 IPs
  * Min: `/28` = 16 IPs
* Subnets can’t span AZs. Each subnet is tied to a single **Availability Zone**.
* Reserved IPs: First 4 and last in every subnet (used by AWS).

---

## 🔁 5. Routing in a VPC

### 🔸 VPC Router

* Internal AWS virtual device.
* Present in every subnet as `subnet+1` IP (e.g., `10.0.1.1` in `10.0.1.0/24`).

### 🔸 Route Tables

* Decide **where traffic goes** when leaving a subnet.
* Every subnet must be linked to **1 route table**.

### 🔸 Routes:

* A route = **Destination + Target**
* Most specific route wins:

  * `/32` (single IP) > `/24` (256 IPs) > `/16` (65K IPs)
* **Default Route** (`0.0.0.0/0`) = "send everything else this way"

---

## 🌍 6. Internet Gateway (IGW) – Door to the Internet

For a **subnet to be public**, it must:

1. Assign **public IPs**.
2. Be connected to an **IGW**.
3. Route traffic to the IGW via **route table**.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ 7. Bastion Host – Admin’s Gateway

* A **secure jump server** used to access private servers.
* Connected publicly, used by trusted admins via **SSH/RDP**.
* Must be **hardened, monitored**, and protected with **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.

---

## 🔄 8. NAT – Letting Private Servers Access the Internet

### 🔸 What It Does:

* Rewrites **source IPs** so private devices can access the internet.
* **Like your home router** does for all your devices.

### 🔸 Types:

* **Static NAT**: One private IP maps to one public IP.
* **Dynamic NAT**: Many-to-one or many-to-many IP mapping (used in homes or NAT Gateways).

---

## 🧱 9. Network ACLs (NACLs) – Basic Subnet Security

* Works at **Layer 4** (TCP/UDP).
* Subnet-level firewalls.
* **Stateless**: Must allow both **inbound and outbound** for a two-way flow.
* Rules are **numbered** and **evaluated in order**.
* `*` (implicit deny) is the default rule.

---

## ⚡ 10. Ephemeral Ports – Temporary Ports Used by Clients

* When you connect to a server (e.g., HTTPS on port 443), your **client chooses a random port** for the response.
* Important for **NACLs**, because both sides must be allowed.

---

## 🔗 11. VPC Peering – Linking Two VPCs

* Direct connection between two VPCs (even across accounts or regions).
* Uses **private IPs** for communication.
* No need for internet or VPN — uses AWS backbone.
* Useful for:

  * Mergers
  * Shared services
  * Vendor/client integrations

---

## 🛣 12. VPC Endpoints – Access AWS Services Privately

* Used to access AWS services **without an internet gateway**.
* Types:

  * **Gateway Endpoint**: S3, DynamoDB
  * **Interface Endpoint**: Other services like SQS, SNS

---

## 📖 13. DNS – Internet’s Phonebook

### 🔸 Purpose:

* Turns domain names like `amazon.com` into IP addresses like `54.239.28.85`.

### 🔸 Structure:

* **Root Servers**: Top of the hierarchy.
* **TLDs**: `.com`, `.org`, `.uk`, etc.
* **Subdomains**: e.g., `blog.google.com`

### 🔸 Zone File:

* Holds all records for a domain.

### 🔸 Record Types (with simple explanation):

| Type      | Purpose                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **A**     | IPv4 address                        |
| **AAAA**  | IPv6 address                        |
| **CNAME** | Alias (e.g., `www` → `example.com`) |
| **MX**    | Email routing                       |
| **NS**    | Delegates DNS to another server     |
| **PTR**   | IP to domain (reverse lookup)       |
| **TXT**   | Holds text data (e.g., SPF/DKIM)    |
| **CERT**  | Encryption certificates             |
| **SRV**   | Service location                    |
| **SOA**   | Metadata about the DNS zone         |

---

## 🎯 14. Route 53 – AWS DNS Service

### 🔸 Routing Types:

| Type              | Function                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Simple**        | Randomized IPs returned         |
| **Failover**      | Uses secondary if primary fails |
| **Weighted**      | Traffic split by %, e.g., 70/30 |
| **Latency-based** | Chooses closest region          |
| **Geolocation**   | Routes based on user’s country  |

## 🔁 5. Routing in a VPC – How Traffic Finds Its Way

### 🔸 **VPC Router**

* AWS automatically creates a **virtual router** for every VPC.
* This router is **not visible** or configurable like a physical one, but it handles routing for all subnets.
* For every **subnet**, the router appears as the **subnet+1 IP address**.

  * 🧠 **Example**: If a subnet is `10.0.1.0/24`, the router address is `10.0.1.1`. This is often the default gateway used by EC2 instances in that subnet.

### 🔸 **Route Tables**

* A **route table** is a set of rules that determine where traffic leaving a subnet should go.
* Every subnet **must be associated** with exactly **one** route table.
* By default, there's a **main route table** that all subnets use unless you explicitly assign a custom one.

### 🔸 **What’s Inside a Route Table?**

Each route includes:

* **Destination**: A CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`, `0.0.0.0/0`).
* **Target**: Where to send the traffic (e.g., Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, another subnet, VPC Peering connection).

### 🔸 **Routing Behavior**

* **Most specific route wins**:

  * `/32` (1 IP) beats `/24` (256 IPs) which beats `/16` (65,536 IPs).
  * This allows precise control over traffic flow.
* **Default route**:

  * `0.0.0.0/0` (IPv4) or `::/0` (IPv6) is the **catch-all** for any traffic not matched by other routes — often used to send traffic to the **internet gateway** or **NAT gateway**.

> 🧠 *Analogy*: Think of routing as your phone’s map app. You can set a general direction (like going to “downtown”) but if you define a specific address (like a friend’s house), your GPS will take that exact route first.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ 7. Bastion Host – The Secure Admin Gateway

### 🔸 **What is a Bastion Host?**

* A **bastion host** (aka jump box) is a special-purpose server placed in a **public subnet** that lets you **securely access private resources** in a VPC.
* You connect to the bastion (public IP), then from there, connect **internally** to other instances (which have **no public IPs**).

### 🔸 **How It Works**

1. You SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) into the bastion host from your laptop.
2. Then, from the bastion, you SSH/RDP into the private EC2 instances.

### 🔸 **Security Best Practices**

* Place bastion in its **own subnet** with **restricted NACLs and security groups**.
* Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
* Harden it with updates, logging, and restricted access (IP whitelisting).
* Only allow **admin-level users** to access it.
* Monitor using **AWS CloudTrail** or **CloudWatch Logs**.

> 🧠 *Analogy*: A bastion is like the secure lobby in a building — the only place where outside visitors can enter. After verification, they can access the inner rooms, but no one can go directly from the street to those private areas.

---

## 🧱 9. Network ACLs (NACLs) – Subnet-Level Security Guards

### 🔸 **What Are NACLs?**

* **Network Access Control Lists** (NACLs) act as **packet-level firewalls** for subnets.
* Control traffic **in and out of a subnet**, not individual EC2 instances.
* Operate at **Layer 4** of the OSI model (TCP/UDP).

### 🔸 **Key Characteristics**

* **Stateless**: You must define rules for both **inbound and outbound** traffic.

  * If you allow inbound port 80, you must separately allow outbound ephemeral ports.
* **Rule Evaluation Order**:

  * Rules are numbered.
  * The **lowest-numbered rule that matches** is applied.
  * If no rule matches, the `*` rule (implicit deny) blocks the traffic.
* Subnets can only be associated with **one NACL** at a time.

### 🔸 **Example Rule Set**:

| Rule # | Type | Port | Source         | Action |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| 100    | TCP  | 22   | 203.0.113.0/24 | ALLOW  |
| 200    | ALL  | \*   | 0.0.0.0/0      | DENY   |

> 🧠 *Analogy*: Think of NACLs as border security for a country — they decide who can cross the border in either direction. But once inside, your building’s door (security group) takes over finer control.

---

## ⚡ 10. Ephemeral Ports – The Invisible Return Address

### 🔸 **What Are They?**

* **Ephemeral (temporary) ports** are randomly chosen ports used by clients to receive replies from a server.
* When you visit a website (e.g., HTTPS on port 443), your computer opens a **random port** like 49152 to receive the response.

### 🔸 **Why They Matter for NACLs**

* Because **NACLs are stateless**, they need **explicit rules** for both directions:

  * Allow **outbound port 443** (request to HTTPS)
  * Allow **inbound ephemeral port** (response from HTTPS server)

### 🔸 **Typical Ephemeral Port Ranges**:

* Linux: 32768–60999
* Windows: 49152–65535

> 🧠 *Analogy*: Imagine sending a letter to a company (HTTPS on 443) but instead of your home address, you write a temporary mailbox number where you’ll pick up the reply — that’s an ephemeral port.

---

## 🔗 11. VPC Peering – Private Links Between VPCs

### 🔸 **What Is VPC Peering?**

* A **private network connection** between two VPCs.
* Allows resources in both VPCs to talk over **private IPs**.
* **No need for internet, VPN, or NAT**.
* Traffic travels via the secure AWS **global backbone** (not the public internet).

### 🔸 **Use Cases**:

* Connecting VPCs of:

  * Two different departments
  * Two AWS accounts (e.g., company and vendor)
  * Two regions (with **inter-region peering**)

### 🔸 **Important Notes**:

* Peering is **non-transitive**:

  * If VPC-A peers with VPC-B and VPC-B peers with VPC-C, **A can’t talk to C**.
* Requires **route table updates** on both sides.
* **No overlapping CIDR blocks** allowed.

> 🧠 *Analogy*: It’s like building a **private tunnel** between two buildings so employees from each can walk across without stepping onto the public road.

---

## 🛣 12. VPC Endpoints – Private Access to AWS Services

### 🔸 **Purpose**:

* Lets your VPC **privately connect** to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) **without using an internet gateway** or public IPs.
* Your resources stay inside your **private network**.

### 🔸 **Types of Endpoints**:

#### 1. **Gateway Endpoints**

* **For S3 and DynamoDB only**
* Added to **route tables**
* Traffic to these services is **redirected privately** without ever hitting the public internet.

#### 2. **Interface Endpoints**

* For **other AWS services** (e.g., SQS, SNS, Secrets Manager)
* Powered by **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** in your subnets.
* Acts like an internal “door” to services — secure, private, and reliable.

### 🔸 **Benefits**:

* **Improves security** (no need for public IPs or NAT).
* **Reduces cost** by avoiding NAT Gateway data charges.
* Maintains **compliance** by not sending data over the public internet.

> 🧠 *Analogy*: A VPC Endpoint is like getting an internal delivery chute installed in your office — you can receive and send data without ever going outside.
